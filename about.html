        <p id="description">
            I am a video game enthusiast who has a passion for emerging technologies and designing. I am currently enrolled at The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor - School of Information as a Master's student, majoring in Human Computer Interaction.<br><br>
            My love for designing and technology along with my curiosity and need for adventure have encouraged me to work towards pursuing a career in the same. I want to create experiences that stay with people forever and transcend boundaries of their current imagination.<br><br>
            Outside the world of design and gaming, enjoy gastronomy, traveling, star gazing, music and nerd-ing it out with my friends over movies and comics!<br><br>
